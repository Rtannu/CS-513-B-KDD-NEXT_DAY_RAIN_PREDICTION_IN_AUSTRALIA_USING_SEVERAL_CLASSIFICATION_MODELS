# CS-513-B-KDD | NEXT DAY RAIN PREDICTION IN AUSTRALIA USING SEVERAL CLASSIFICATION MODELS

## ***Problem Statement:***
Rain plays a vital role in our lives. Clouds are responsible for bringing rain to humans. In order to forecast when it will rain, the weather department tries to do some forecasting.
So, I am interested to predict next-day rain using different classificaton model / machine learning algorithm / data mining techniques from 10 years of daily weather observations of many locations across Australia. In addition, I am interested in investigating the possible causes of rain that falls the next day. 


## ***DataSet:***
There are 23 features in the dataset that are represented in the form of columns, out of which I may choose to use the most important features during the implementation .I may use different feature reductions techniques to select the important features.<br>

The daily observations are available from :  http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data <br>
An example of latest weather observations in Canberra: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW2801.latest.shtml
<br>
Definitions adapted from :  http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW0000.shtml

Data source: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/ and http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data <br>

## ***Implementation Strategy and algorithms Used:***
***I have decided to implement and compare 6 different models***<br>
1. Random Forest<br>
2. Logistic Regression <br>
3. K-means <br>
4. Decision Tree <br>
5. Naive Bayes <br>
6. Support vector machine

## ***Model metrics and Evaluation:***
Evaluation of different models used in project uses confusion matrix for understanding the features patterns with Correlation Matrix and EDA and ROC plot for accuracy comparison and k-fold cross validation for minimizing overfitting.
